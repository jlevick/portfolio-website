                  Aspect is a comprehensive astrology resource offering access to your unique birth chart, vetted professional astrologers, and a community of astro-enthusiasts.

               <h2>01 Research</h2> 
               <p>
                Astrology is inherently personal, offering meaning and guidance in increasingly despairing times. 
                With this in mind, it is no wonder that the he “mystical services” industry is worth $2.2 billion and growing, with venture capitalists backing astrology apps like Aspect. Right now there are no other apps that provide what Aspect does, allowing us prime entry in to a budding and profitable market.
               </p>
               <h3>Top 3 Market Gaps to Fill</h3>
               <p>
                (Based on S.W.O.T analyses of Sanctuary Astrology and Kasamba).
               </p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Pricing - Upfront, Transparent pricing model.</li>
                    <li>Qualifications - Vetted astrologers with qualifications listed.</li>
                    <li>Reviews - Easy to find user reviews.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                After determining the viability of the project, I surveyed 22 people in order to learn who they are, how invested they are in astrology, and what they look for in an astrologer. The survey was open to all.

                <p>
                    The most important criteria when seeking an astrologer:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verified Expertise (63.6%)</li>
                    <li>Astrologer's Background (63.6%)</li>
                    <li>Client Reviews (45.5%)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    People ultimately don't book astrology readings because they are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unsure of the astrologer's credibility (64.7%)</li>
                    <li>Unsure of whom to book with (64.7%)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The survey was followed up by user interviews with four self identified astro-enthusiasts. I wanted to  better understand why people are interested in astrology, why they do (or don't) work with an astrologer, and what they expect from astrological content.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users engage with astrology for fun, connection, and self knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Users won't book readings if they are not certain the astrologer is trustworthy.</li>
                    <li>No single astrology resource provides all the information users want.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Based on the research findings, I crafted a problem statement and initial hypothesis.
                <h4>
                    Users need a convenient way to discover qualified astrologers, connect with fellow astrology enthusiasts, and learn about themselves through their own unique birth chart.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We will know our problem statement to be true when:
                <ul>
                    <li>Users no longer waste time contemplating which astrologer to book with.</li>
                    <li>Users no longer spend time researching their own personal astrology.</li>
                    <li>Users are able to connect with others who have similar interests.</li>
                </ul>
                all in one single app.
                If we focus on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Offering inclusive astrology experts</li>
                    <li>Matching users with astrologers</li>
                    <li>Showing costs and reviews up front</li>
                    <li>Providing personalized astrology content</li>
                    <li>Creating an interactive community space</li>
                </ul>
                We will be well positioned to break in to the market with a product like no other.

                <h3>User Persona's</h3>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the prior research and hours of affinity mapping, two distinct personas were created, as well as their mental models, task analyses, and user flows.
                    User flows helped me plan what features and screens were necessary in order for a user to complete a given task.

                Once I knew who I was designing for and what screens I absolutely needed, I employed a hybrid card sort to form the site map for Aspect. I then began lo-fi wireframing with pen & paper.
                In order to bring clarity to my designs I chose to include copy. I began designing in Figma once I felt confident in my direction.

                <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information Overload: Astrologer's profile is too busy.</li>
                    <li>Confusing Copy: “Readings” copy on menu is confusing.</li>
                    <li>Expectations: Ssers expected a way to contact astrologer prior to booking.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Changes Implemented:</h3>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Designed drop downs for About Me and Qualifications in astrologer's profile.</li>
                    <li>Changed copy from “Readings” (in menu) to “Readers”.</li>
                    <li>Designed Messages feature (and button/copy on astrologer's profile).</li>

                <p>
                The feedback I received from usability testing allowed me to clean up screens, reducing confusion. Based on this testing I redesigned three screens and 12 participants voted on which they liked best. Below is one of the three screens I preference tested, the Home screen.

                <p>
                Before finalizing designs I participated in design critiques with 5 peers, receiving (and giving) feedback. Below is one example of feedback I received and how I implemented changes.

            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Reasoning:</h4>
                <p>
                I agreed that this is confusing out of context.
                Initially my thought was the bell icon made sense because in the Rates & Info overlay for Schedule Reading, the user learns that if they want to book a shorter reading they can tap the bell icon and will be alerted when the astrologer is available.
                However, the user doesn't find this out until later, and only if they click on More Info.
                    
                This also made me think I need a third status, "In Reading", as a way to show the astrologer is online but busy at the moment. In the future I'd like to think deeper about adding this feature, perhaps including a timer that shows how much longer they are busy for so a user can gauge their actions on that info. 
                That will take some time to design in an aesthetically pleasing, user friendly way and thusly I didn't move forward with the idea for now.

                I was thoughtful in the choices I made regarding feedback and used my design system, style guide, and web accessibility knowledge to defend any decision to not implement changes.

                    As a new product on the market, the KPI (key performance indicator) I would measure is user return rate. This is a relatively easy metric to track and holds invaluable insight. How many users are booking an astrologer through our platform, and how many are returning to book again? 
                    If the user experience is poor because of the apps' flow, the user interface, the copy/content, the astrology experts, or any other number of reasons, we may find users do not return.<br>
                    <br>Final iterations took in to account web accessibility guidelines, usability heuristics, and the real-life feedback of everyone who helped shape Aspect.<br> 
                    <br>I designed a minimum viable product with 3 distinct features that offers users exactly what they need, all in one convenient app.<br>
                    <br>I believe Aspect is a genuinely profitable business venture. Testing would need to be done on a much larger scale with more participants but I stand behind the idea as an entry point in to the growing market of Mystical Services.
